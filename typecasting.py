# Two Types Of Typecasting
# 1.Explicit typecasting
# 2.intrinsic typecasting


# 1.Explicit typecasting
a = "1"
# a = 1
b = "2"
# b = 2
print("The Sum of the both number" , int(a) + int(b))
# Conversion Of One Dataatypes Into Another data types


# 2.Intrinsic typecasting
a = 1
b = 2.5
print(a+b , "And the type of this integer is " , type(a+b))
