# 🐍 Shiv's Daily Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! 🚀  
Here, I document my **daily progress** as I learn Python from scratch and gradually move towards mastering the language.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repo contains:
- Daily Python practice files
- Notes from tutorials 
- Projects and exercises
- Concept-based scripts (loops, functions, OOP, etc.)

## 📅 Daily Progress

I'm currently following a structured plan:
- ✅ 70% of Python completed
- 📈 Fast-tracking remaining modules
- 📝 Weekly revision of Python notes every Sunday

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- VS Code / PyCharm
- Jupyter Notebook (sometimes)
- Git for version control
